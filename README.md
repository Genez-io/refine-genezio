# Data Provider for Refine and Genezio

About genezio: https://genezio.com/

About Refine: https://refine.dev/


Using this data provider, each react resource is mapped to a Genezio class. The Genezio classes have to implement the expected functions as explained in [this interface](https://github.com/bogdanripa/refine-genezio/blob/main/example/server/DataProvider.ts)

See a the code behind and step by step instructions on hopw to deploy this data provider in the [example](https://github.com/bogdanripa/refine-genezio/tree/main/example) folder.

And a working demo of this implementation: https://beige-mild-gull.app.genez.io/

This is a serverless backend implementation using genezio classes and functions (FaaS or Functions as a Service)
